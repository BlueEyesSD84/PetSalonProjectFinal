        <h2>About the developer</h2>
      <p>
        I have been working in the IT industry for over 20+ years.  In those years I mainly worked as an IT Tech, specifically working on equipment. 
      </p>
        <p>
        Prior to working in the IT industry, I was in the U.S. Navy for 20 years.  I worked mainly on Aircraft Carriers on the flight deck as an Aviation Boatswain's Mate.  If you've ever seen the movie 'Top Gun' at the beginning of the movie, there is a guy wearing a yellow coat waiving his hands directing the aircarft around the flight deck.  That's what I did for the Navy.

          <p>
            I decided my passion is web design.  I've always felt great satisfaction in being able to type code and have it product instant results.  In addion, I enjoy being able to make people's ideas into action on the web.  I am training at San Diego Global Knowledge University to become a Full Stack Developer.
